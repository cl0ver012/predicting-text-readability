#### Abstract

Text readability is defined as the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. Traditionally, readability formulas have been used to determine the readability of a text. In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) methods coupled with machine learning have been applied to solve this task -- this is the approach used in this work. NLP methods have been used to extract relevant features from a text. These features are given as an input to several machine learning models which predict readability level. The models were evaluated on the WeeBit dataset. They have been compared with each other and with traditional formulas using statistical significance testing. The tests showed that machine learning models outperform traditional readability formulas.
